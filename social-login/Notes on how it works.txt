1. user clicks sign in
2. JS will try and submit the username and password form on the /login.asp page, if that fails (means there is no account) then
3. it will click the "continue" button on the /login.asp page (may need to use jqery selector $('somebutton a')[0].click(); )
4. on the registration page it should auto populate both email and both password fields
5. then it will automatically "click" the continue button on that page 
6. the user will be brought to where they enter their billing info.
